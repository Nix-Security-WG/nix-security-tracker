"""
Utilities to sync the user groups in our database with GitHub teams in order to correctly map permissions.

We implement a class, an instance of which must be attached to the server on startup in order to conveniently:
- register a hook to update user information on user signup
- cache remote data that only needs to be fetched once
- access data that needs to be fetched repeatedly
It will persist for the entire application lifetime.
